# Primary Colors Detection

## Overview

This Python script performs Primary Colors Detection in an image using KMeans clustering. The script features a Tkinter-based GUI for easy image upload and interactive visualization. It utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to identify dominant colors, display color proportions, and enhance the processed image with labeled rectangles. The final result is saved as 'output.png'.

## Features

- Image upload through a Tkinter GUI.
- KMeans clustering for identifying dominant colors.
- Color proportion visualization using Matplotlib.
- Enhanced image display with labeled rectangles.
